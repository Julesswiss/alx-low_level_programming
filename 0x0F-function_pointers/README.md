Functions pointers*

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX. It aims to learn about function pointers in C language.

*Technologies*

C files are compiled using gcc and are written according to the C90 standard.

*Files*

All of the following files are programs written in C language

*Filenames and descriptions*

0-print_name.c	: A function that prints a name.

*1-array_iterator.c* : A function that	 executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

*2-int_index.c* A function that searches for an integer.

*3-calc.h* : A header file that contains all function prototypes and data structures.

*3-op_functions.c*: A file that contains functions that calculates arithmetic operations.

*3-get_op_func.c*: A function pointer that returns the pointer of the arithmetic functions.

*3-main.c* Entry point, file containing the main function.

*100-main_opcodes.c* : Prints the opcodes of its own main function.
