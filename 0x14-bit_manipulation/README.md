## Bit manipulation ##

## Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX - Holberton School.##
 
It aims to learn about bits manipulation and the use of bitwise operators in C language.

## Technologies ##

Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)

C files are compiled using gcc, using the option -Wall -Werror - Wextra -pedantic -std = gnu89

C files are written according to the C90 standard.

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Files ##
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

Filename - Description

0-binary_to_uint.c: Function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int

1-print_binary.c: A function that prints the binary representation of a number.

2-get_bit.c: A function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

3-set_bit.c: A function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

4-clear_bit.c: A function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

5-flip_bits.c: A function that returns the number of bits needed to flip to get from one number to another.

100-get_endianess.c: Checks the endianness.

101-password: A script that contains the password of crackme3 file
