~
Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies a ALX. The aim of the task is to improve my knowledge of pointers and arrays in C language.
~
0-reset_to_98.c- It involed writing a function that taking a pointer to an int as parameter and updating the value it points to 98
~
1-swap.c - Involves swaping the values of two integers
~
2-strlen.c - Writing a function that returns the length of a string.
~
3-puts.c - Prints a string and a newline to stdout
~
4-print_rev.c - Function that prints a string in reverse
~
5-rev_string.c - Function that reverses a string
~
6-puts2.c - A function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character as well as a new line
~
7-puts_half.c -Prints half of a string and a new line
~
8-print_array.c - Prints n elements of an array of integers and a new line.
~
9-strcpy.c - A function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
