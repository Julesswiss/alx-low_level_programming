* Recursions 

* Recursion, the process of repeating items in a self similar way. Calling a function inside the same function 

* Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX School 
* It aims to learn about  recursion and how to implement it in C language.

* Files
* All of the following files are programs written in C:

* Filename Description

* 0-puts_recursion.c: That prints a string

* 1-print_rev_recursion.c: A function that prints a string in reverse

* 2-strlen_recursion.c: Returning the length of a string

* 3-factorial.c: A function that returns the factorial of a given number

* 4-pow_recursion.c: A function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y

* 5-sqrt_recursion.c: A function that returns the natural square root of a number

* 6-is_prime_number.c: A function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0

* 100-is_palindrome.c: A function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not

* 101-wildcmp.c: Compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical. Otherwise, returns 0
