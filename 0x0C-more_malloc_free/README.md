*Project More malloc, free*

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX School. 

The aim is to learn about how to use malloc, calloc, realloc, free and exit functions in C language.

*Technologies*
C files are to be compiled using gcc and all of the following files are programs written in C:

*Filenames and Descriptions*

*Mandatory*
*0-malloc_checked.c* - Allocates memory using malloc.
*1-string_nconcat.c*	- Concatenates two strings.
*2-calloc.c* -	Allocates memory for an array, using malloc.
*3-array_range.c* - Creates an array of integers.

*Advanced*
*100-realloc.c*	- Reallocates a memory block using malloc and free.
*101-mul.c* - 	Multiplies two positive numbers
